3 Feb 2013:

attempted to add transaction as follows:
Date= 31 Jan 2013
Category= Groceries
Name= Walmart Purchases
Amount = 14.49
Notes= null
Account= EBT

Got the following error
ORA-00001: unique constraint (MAC_FINANCIAL_ADMIN.SYS_C0020064) violated

The same happened when trying to do a combo transaction on 31 Jan 2013 so I think it has to be a mix up with the date
